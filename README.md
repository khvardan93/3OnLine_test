A simple match 3 game

It contains a scene with an NxM grid of colored tiles, L tile colors in total. When the scene starts, the grid is filled with tiles randomly, but never 3 same tiles one after another in a row, horizontal or vertical. 

The player has an ability to swap two neighboring tiles. 

If a match of 3 in line happens after the swap, those 3 are destroyed and their upper neighbors fall down to fill the gap. New ones spawn from the top to keep the grid filled with tiles, but automatic match of 3 never happens after their spawn.

Also there is a possibility for another engineer to simulate 1000000 random player moves in a row.
